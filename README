A common problem with bluesombrero is people register
a player using different bluesom accounts from season
to season.  Mom may use her account to register Mary
one season and Dad my register her using a different
account the next season.

This causes an issue because the player's rating does
not carry over to the newly registered player. (The
player retains their AYSO ID but is issued a new
bluesom player id. And ratings are tied to player
ids, not AYSO IDs. Quite annoying.

This tool takes two enrollment reports. For players
in the right report, it looks to see if they are
missing a rating. And if they are, it tries to find
their rating from the left report.

Example:
./findratings.py --left my2017.csv --right my2018.csv

This will spit out the names and ratings of all
players in the my2018.csv report that do not have
a rating in my2018.csv but do have a rating in
my2017.csv.

The format of the enrollment reports must conform
to this...
AYSO ID: column 24
Evaluation: column 25
Player First Name: column 4
Player Last Name: column 5
